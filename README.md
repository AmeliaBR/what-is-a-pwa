# What the Heck is a PWA?

What exactly is a **P**rogressive **W**eb **A**pp (PWA)? What makes it different from a regular old web app?

This repository contains slides for an introduction to Progressive Web Apps talks, first presented by Amelia Bellamy-Royds at the Exchange.js meetup in Edmonton, 5 April 2018.

The slides themselves are a PWA demo, viewable at the GitHub Pages site for this repository.
